# User Story Documentation Publishing

## Purpose

Publish finalized story documentation to Confluence as a human-readable record after the SDLC is complete.

This skill is deliberately outside the SDLC lifecycle. It does not approve or advance lifecycle state.

## Inputs

Required:
- Application
- Application Root
- Story ID / Source Reference
- Confluence Space Key or unambiguous Space Name

Optional:
- Story summary
- parent page title/id
- subset of document types to publish

## Canonical Source

Repository artifacts under:

`<application-root>/docs/sdlc/`

are authoritative.

Confluence must never become the source of truth for SDLC status.

## Preconditions

The publishing request should normally occur after:
- implementation tasks are completed/accepted
- code review is complete
- final verification is complete

If the story is not complete, do not infer completion. Publish only when the user explicitly requests publication of the available state, and label it accurately.

## Page Tree

Use a single story root:

`<STORY-ID> - <Story Summary>`

Children:

- `01 - Story & Requirements`
- `02 - HLD`
- `03 - LLD`
- `04 - Design Review`
- `05 - Implementation Summary`
- `06 - Code Review`
- `07 - Verification Report`
- `08 - Release / PR Summary`

Only create child pages backed by actual source artifacts.

## HLD/LLD Compatibility Mode

If the framework still has only `architecture.md`, derive two documentation views from it:

HLD:
- context
- drivers
- major boundaries
- technology stack
- external integrations
- high-level data flow
- deployment
- security/privacy boundaries
- major tradeoffs/ADRs

LLD:
- detailed components/modules
- contracts/interfaces
- detailed data model
- normalization/validation
- request/response or sequence flow
- state transitions
- error handling
- persistence
- testability details

Do not invent design content during this transformation.

## Idempotent Upsert Algorithm

For each intended page:

1. search in the target space using the exact Story ID and title
2. prefer a page already beneath the intended story root
3. retrieve it and verify identity
4. update if it exists
5. create if it does not exist
6. retrieve again to verify

Never rely on title search alone when multiple spaces may contain the same title.

## External Write Authorization

One explicit authorization may cover the full bounded story documentation package.

If authorization is not explicit in the current request, stop before the first create/update operation and ask for it.

Do not request approval separately for every page.

## Failure Handling

Return `BLOCKED` when:
- Confluence MCP tools are unavailable
- credentials do not permit page access/write
- target space cannot be identified safely
- more than one plausible story root exists and identity cannot be resolved
- required source artifacts cannot be read

Never bypass MCP by reading credentials and calling REST directly.

## Publication Report

Return:

- Publication Status
- Story Root
- pages created
- pages updated
- pages skipped because no source exists
- verification result
- any permission/access blockers

This report is documentation evidence only, not SDLC state.
